            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170676:3"/>but by often meditating on theſe things your hearts may be brought into a more ſerious and heavenly frame? Meditation is a holy kinde of uſury, it is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Sermons to uſe, which brings in no ſmall profit at the yeares end. Meditation is a duty which carries meat in the mouth of it; <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſſe, while I meditate on thee,</hi> Pſalme <hi>63.4, 5.</hi> There is little written (ſo farre as I know) upon this ſubject. Moſt Diſcourſes of this nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe into ejaculations. I have with the help of God cut out my way thorough the rock, not
<pb facs="tcp:170676:4"/>finding any path that others had gone in before me; ſo that I have not offered that to you <hi>which coſt me nothing;</hi> for the ſtile of it, it is plaine; but truth, when it is in the plaineſt dreſſe, is moſt comely. The ſtar ſhines brighteſt in its native luſtre. <hi>Divinity</hi> hath ſo much intrinſecal beauty, that it needs no art of wit or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſet it off. Who goes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyder a pearl? or paint over gold? this would but imbaſe and eclipſe it; It is a ſigne of a wanton Chriſtian to look moſt at the fringing and garniſhing of a Truth. I wiſh it be not the ſin of many in this City, they like the dreſſing, but loath the food. The
<pb facs="tcp:170676:4"/>blew flowers which grow among the corn, make a fine ſhew, and are pleaſing to the eye, yet are prejudicial to the Harveſt. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical flouriſhes may pleaſe the fancies of men, but I much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether they will not leſſen Chriſts ſpiritual barveſt at the end of the world. When men preach rather words than mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they catch peoples ears, not their ſoules; they do but court, not convert. If the patients wound bleeds, nay rankles, it is better for him to have a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made in the fleſh, than to binde it about with ſilk, or dreſs it with aromatick oyntments. True it is, Miniſters ought to
<pb facs="tcp:170676:5"/>cloath the truths they preach in decent expreſſions to preſerve them from contempt; (though they muſt come <hi>in plainneſſe of ſpeech, not in rudeneſſe of ſpeech.)</hi> But, let them take heed, leſt with their affected new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coynd phraſes, (unſutable to that gravity the Apoſtle ſpeaks of
<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 2.7</note>) they adulterate and corrupt the ſimplicity of the Word, like ſome kind of ſauces and compounds which take away the natural taſte, and ſavour of the meat. As for you (my friends) I hope the Lord hath given, (at leaſt ſome of you) a ſpiritual pallate to rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and thirſt after, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:170676:5"/>1</hi> Pet. <hi>2.2.</hi> A ſavoury heart is for wholſome doctrine: How glad ſhould I be (dear friends) if I might either by preaching, or writing become ſavingly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for your good, and before I die, might help to make up an happy match between Chriſt and you

But O that I might ſee an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of holineſſe among you, that more converts might be brought in, and as ſo many jewels make the Crown of Christ ſhine the brighter; do not hearken to the Syrene ſongs of the world;

Among theſe, that of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Meditation</hi> is one, when, (as the Apoſtle ſaith of the bleſſed Angels, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.) the heart deſires to <hi>look</hi> into the myſteries of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Ever ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men have had the diſpoſition of <hi>Adam, to flie</hi> away, and <hi>to hide</hi> from the preſence of the Lord. Natural men are without God in the world, he is <hi>not in all their thoughts,</hi> they could be well enough content to have him <hi>ceaſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them,</hi> Eſay 30.11. He is every where elſe to be found, onely ſhut out of the hearts of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>The heart never willingly fixeth on God, till he be the <hi>Treaſure</hi> of it; for where a mans <hi>treaſure</hi> is, there will his <hi>heart</hi> be alſo. It canot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily

                  <p>There is nothing of a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and roving temper than the minde of man. Some have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the ſtudy of Mathematicks to fix the volatile agilitie thereof; but certainly the more <hi>ſerious,</hi> the more <hi>ſetled</hi> the ſoul is. Nothing therefore will ſo ballace and compoſe it, as true <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which doth of all other things make it the moſt <hi>ſerious,</hi> the moſt willing <hi>to acquaint it ſelf with God, that it may be at peace,</hi> Job 22.21.

The more it taſteth of his <hi>favour,</hi> the more it longeth after his <hi>glory,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.17, 18. What the Philoſopher ſaith of all <hi>knowledge,</hi> is indeed true onely of the <hi>knowledge of God and Chriſt,</hi> that it is <hi>quies intellectus.</hi> And therefore our Saviour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>eternal life,</hi> John 17.3.

Meditation is the ſouls <hi>reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it ſelf;</hi> a Chriſtian, when he goes to meditate, muſt lock up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the world. The world ſpoiles meditation; <hi>Chriſt went apart into the Mount to pray,</hi> Mat. 14.23. So, go apart when you are to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. <hi>Iſaac went out to meditate in the field,</hi> Gen. 24.63. he ſequeſtred and retired himſelf that he might
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170676:46"/>take a walk with God by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Zacheus</hi> had a minde to ſee Chriſt, and he got out of the crowd, <hi>He ran before, and climbed up into a ſycamore-tree to ſee him,</hi> Luke 19.3, 4. So when we would ſee God, we muſt get out of the crowd of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſe, we muſt climb up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tree by retiredneſſe of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and there we ſhall have the beſt proſpect of heaven. The worlds muſick will either play us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, or diſtract us in our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When a more is gotten into the eye, it hinders the ſight; when worldly thoughts, as motes, are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the minde (which is the eye of the ſoul) it cannot look up ſo ſtedfaſtly to heaven by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore, as when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> went to ſacrifice, <hi>he left his ſervant and the Aſſe at the bottom of the hill,</hi> Gen. 22.5. So when a Chriſtian is going up the hill of meditation, he ſhould leave all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170676:46"/>cares at the bottome of the hill; that he may be alone, and take a turne in heaven. If the wings of the bird are full of lime, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

When thou art going up the mount of meditation, take heed the world doth not follow thee, and throw thee down from the top of this pinacle. This is the firſt thing, the ſouls retiring of it ſelfe; lock and bolt the doore againſt the world.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We may conclude it is a good duty, becauſe it is againſt the ſtream of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature; as he ſaid, you may know that Religion is right which <hi>Nero</hi> perſecutes; ſo you may know that is a good duty which the heart oppoſeth.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170676:49"/>It is doing of pennance; now truly, there needs no other reaſon to prove a duty to be good, than the reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a carnal heart.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170676:95"/>meditation is like a ſoldier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms or a workman without tools. 1. Without Meditation the truths of God <hi>will not stay with us,</hi> the heart is hard and the memory ſlipery, and without meditation all is loſt; meditation imprints and faſtens a truth in the mind, it is like the Selvedge which keeps the cloath from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.

Meditation fetcheth life in a Truth. There are many truths ly, as it were, in the heart dead, which when we Meditate upon, they begin to have life and heat in them.

                     <p n="1">1. The Farmer Meditates on his acres of land not upon his ſoul: his Meditation is how he may improve a barren piece of ground, not how he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a barren minde: he will not let his ground lie fallow, but he lets his heart lye fallow: There is no ſpiritual culture, not one ſeed of grace ſown there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Phyſitian meditates upon his receits, but ſeldom on thoſe receits which the Goſpel preſcribes for his ſalvation, Faith and Repentance. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Devil is Phyſitian to the Phyſitian, having given him ſuch ſtupifying phyſick that for the moſt part he dies of a Lethargy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lawyer meditates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common Law, but as for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170676:99"/>Gods law he ſeldom Meditates in it either day or night: the lawyer while he is Meditating on his clients evidences often forgets his own; moſt of this Robe have their ſpiritual evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to <hi>ſeek,</hi> when they ſhould have them to <hi>ſhow.</hi> The tradeſ-man is for the moſt part Meditating upon his wares and drugs: his ſtudy is how he may encreaſe his eſtate and make the ten talents an hundred. He <hi>is cumbred about many things;</hi> he doth not Meditate in the <hi>book of Gods law</hi> but <hi>in his account-book</hi> day and night.

A Chriſtian is moſt himſelf then; What weary devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will there be at night when a man is even tired out with the buſineſs of the day. He will be fitter to ſleep then to meditate. The morning is the queen of the day, then the fancy is quickeſt, the memory ſtrongeſt, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits freſheſt, the organ of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy moſt diſpoſed, having had its recruits by ſleep. Tis a ſure rule, then is the beſt time to ſerve God when we find our ſelves moſt in tune. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart is like a viol ſtrung and put in tune, and then it makes the ſweeteſt melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>

                     <p>The morning thoughts ſtay longeſt with us the day after, the wool takes the firſt die beſt, and it is not eaſily worn out. When the mind receivs the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of good thoughts in the morning, it holds this ſacred dye the better, and like a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in grain, it will not eaſily be loſt. The heart keeps the Reliſh of morning meditations, as a veſſel that receives a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture &amp; ſavor of the Wine that is firſt put into it

Perfume thy minde with heavenly Thoughts in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it will not loſe its ſpiritual fragrancy; Wind up thy heart towards heaven in the beginning of the day, and it will go the better all the day after: It is with receiving thoughts into the minde as it is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170676:111"/>with receiving Gueſts into an Inn, the firſt Gueſts that come fill the beſt rooms in the houſe, if others come after, worſe rooms will ſerve them; So when the mind entertains holy Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for its morning-Gueſts, if afterwards earthly thoughts come, they are put into ſome of the worſt rooms, they lodge loweſt in the affections. The beſt roomes are taken up in the Morning for Chriſt. He that loſeth his heart in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, will hardly finde it again all the day after.</p>

It is a part of that ſolemn Reſpect and Honour we give to God, to let him have <hi>Aurorae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> the firſt thoughts of the day; we give perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the precedency, we let them take the firſt place. If we honour God (whoſe Name is Reverend and Holy) we will
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170676:111"/>let the thoughts of God take place of all other. When the World hath the firſt of our thoughts, 'tis a ſign the world lies uppermoſt, we love it moſt. The firſt thing a covetous man meditates on in the morning is <hi>dea pecunia,</hi> his money; a ſign his Gold lies neareſt to his heart. Oh Chriſtians let God have your morning Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He takes it in diſdain to have the world ſerved before him. Suppoſe a King, and a Yeoman were to dine in the ſame room, and to ſit at two Tables, if the Yeoman ſhould have his meat brought up, &amp; be ſerved firſt, the King might well take it in an high Diſdain, and look upon it as a contempt done to his perſon. When the world ſhall be ſerved firſt, all our morning thoughts attending it, and the Lord ſhall be put off
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170676:112"/>with the Dreggs of the day, when our thoughts begin to run low, is not this a contempt done to the God of Glory?</p>

The dew of a bleſſing <hi>falls ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> now we are likelieſt to have Gods company. If you would meet with a friend, you go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the morning before he be gone out. We read that the Holy Ghoſt came down upon the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3, 4. and it was <hi>in the morning,</hi> as may be gathered from <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, <hi>verſe</hi> 15.

Meditation is an excellent means to profit by the word: reading may bring a truth into the head, meditation brings it into the heart; better meditate on one Sermon than hear five; I obſerve many put up their Bills in our Congregations, and complain that they cannot profit, may not this be the chief reaſon, becauſe they <hi>chew not the cud,</hi> they do not meditate on what they have heard. If an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhould come from heaven, and preach to men, nay if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf were their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, they would never profit without meditation. 'Tis the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the milk that makes it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170676:115"/>turn to cream; &amp; it is the ſetling of a truth in the mind, that makes it turn to ſpiritual ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Bee ſucks the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and then workes it in the Hive, and makes honey of it. The hearing of a truth preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the ſucking of a flower, there muſt be aworking it in the Hive of the heart by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then it turnes to Honey. There is a diſeaſe in children called the Rickets, when they have great heads, but their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer parts are ſmall, and thrive not. I wiſh many of the Profeſſors in <hi>London,</hi> have not the ſpiritual Rickets, they have great heads, much knowledge, but yet they thrive not in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, their heart is faint, their feet feeble, they walk not vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in the waies of God, and the cauſe of this diſeaſe is, the want of meditation. Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170676:116"/>without meditation makes us no better then Divels. Satan is an Angel of light yet black e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Meditation doth make the heart ſerious and then it is ever beſt, Meditation doth bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt the heart; when the ſhip is ballaſted it is not ſo ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the wind, and when the heart is ballaſted with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is not ſo ſoon overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vanity.

Though there be grace in the heart which would be ſtill mounting upward, yet there is much corruption to pull us down; a Chriſtian in this life, is both check'd and ſpur'd; Grace ſpurs him forward in his way to heaven, and then corruption checks him; now here the ſpirit

                  <p n="2">2. It is unworthy of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy ſelf?

Hence I gather, that men may have a ſpeculation of Chriſt, yet be ignorant of him, that is, not know him convincingly; and that they have not a convincing knowledge, is clear; for were they convinced in their conſcience of the
